# Machine learning scripts
Here is a directory for the scripts Ive written to explore various concepts in machine learning

## activations

A few activation function, to be called when constructing individual layers of the neural network, in nn_test

## nn_test

Within, a <b>layer</b> class which can be created with a certain number of neurons with randomly initialized weights and constant bias

<b>backprop</b> performs simple regression back-propagation (no momentum; 1st order in taylor expansion) on a many-layered network of arbitrary size and series of activation functions
